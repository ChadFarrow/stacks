> Stay tuned. Open Beta coming soon.

The goal of the framework is to _help you_ create & maintain frontends, backends, and clouds‚Äîwithout having to worry about the boilerplate. Stacks is a rapid development framework, meeting all your full stack needs.

- Web & Desktop applications
- Serverless & traditional APIs
- Cloud infrastructure creation & maintenance
- Interactive CLIs
- Framework-agnostic component & function libraries
- Deployment & Release Manager _(CI & CD)_

Stacks helps you every step along the way‚Äîin beginner & expert-friendly ways, allowing you to focus on the _what_ and _why_ of your project.

> ‚ÄúConvention over configuration‚Äù is the Stacks mantra. _- Chris_

<!-- ![Atomic UI & FX Design](./docs/assets/diagram.png) -->

## Get Started

It‚Äôs incredibly easy to get started with this framework. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh <(curl stacksjs.org) my-project # wip

# alternatively, if Bun >= v1.0 is installed already,
# you may also get started via:
bunx stacks new my-project
```

## Usage

The following list includes some of the most common ways to interact with the Stacks API.

_Meet the toolkit, Buddy:_

```bash
buddy install # installs all dependencies
buddy dev # starts one of the dev servers (components, functions, views, or docs)
buddy build # follow CLI prompts to select which library (or server) to build
buddy commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
buddy release # creates the releases for the stack & consequently, publishes them to npm
buddy upgrade # auto-update all deps & the Stacks framework

buddy make:model Car # scaffolds a model
buddy make:component HelloWorld # scaffolds a component
buddy make:function HelloWorld # scaffolds a function
buddy make:view hello-world # scaffolds a page (https://my-project.test/hello-world)

buddy --help
```
