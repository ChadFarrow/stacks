# The Modern Component & Function Library

The ultimate goal of the Stacks Framework is to _help you_ create & maintain component & function libraries. It is the most simple & comfortable solution for developers to build highly-modular, widely-accepted & scalable libraries, in a beginner-friendly way.

> _The clever way to build component & function libraries._

**ü§ñ Zero-config by default**¬†¬†

The highly optimized Stacks bundler automagically builds & distributes CommonJS & module library formats. Stacks also automatically generates a Web Component library, Vue 2 & 3 libraries, a composables/functions library, plus all of its relating component & composable type declarations.

**üé® Style with ease**

Create your own style guide using conventions you are familiar with via UnoCSS. _(e.g. Tailwind CSS, Windi CSS, Heroicons, Bootstrap, etc.)_

**‚ö°Ô∏è Next-Gen Developer Experience _(DX)_**

Whether it is the simple setup, modern git commit conventions via commitlint, a modern CI, automated npm package releases & semver versioning, pretty changelog generations, GitHub PR dependency updates, spell-checking, integrated documentation tooling, or a pre-configured playground & examples. _Stacks has it all._

**üí° Delightful VS Code integration**

IDE Capabilities, such as type hints, code completion, code formatting, and more, are all natively built-in within Stacks. _Without the need of Prettier._

**üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Extremely beginner & expert-friendly**

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs & functions without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript‚Äîthat's all you need to dive in now!

## Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework. It's as simple as "Using this template" via the button in top right corner of this page, or run the following snippet of code in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-stack hello-world # wip - under heavy development - check back this weekend!
cd hello-world && npx artisan setup
```

## ü§ñ Usage

The following is a list of some of the most common ways to use interact with Stacks:

```bash
pnpm install # installs deps for all workspaces
pnpm fresh # fresh reinstall of all deps

pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use
pnpm example # run one of the examples (follow CLI prompts)

pnpm build # builds a specific package (follow CLI prompts)
pnpm build:all # builds the library for production-ready use

pnpm commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
pnpm release # releases the library (packages) to npm

pnpm docs:dev # starts local server for the documentation site
pnpm docs:build # builds the docs
pnpm docs:serve # serves the docs
```

_The `package.json` contains additional useful snippets you may want to be aware of._

Because we optimize toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, our primary intention is to always _keep it simple, yet configurable_:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="hello-world-elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Optionally, if you prefer using Vue:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

When using this framework, feel free to adjust it to your needs. It is "simply" a set of rules to help you quickly & efficiently bootstrap & design component libraries, using industry best-practices.

## üß™ Testing

```bash
pnpm test
```
