# The Modern Component & Function Library

The ultimate goal of the Stacks Framework is to _help you_ create & maintain component & function libraries. It is the most simple & comfortable solution for developers to build highly-modular, widely-accepted & scalable libraries, in a beginner-friendly way.

> _The clever way to build component & function libraries._

**ü§ñ Zero-config, by design**¬†¬†

The Stacks bundler automagically generates a Web Component library, Vue 2 & 3 libraries, a composable functions library, plus all of its relating component & composable type declarations.

**üé® Style with ease**

Create your own style guide using conventions you are familiar with via UnoCSS's atomic CSS engine. _(e.g. Tailwind CSS, Windi CSS, Heroicons, Bootstrap, etc.)_

**‚ö°Ô∏è Next-gen Developer Experience _(DX)_**

Whether it is the simple artisan setup, the modern git commit conventions via commitlint, the simple CI, automated npm package releases & semver versioning, pretty changelog generations, automated GitHub PR dependency updates, built-in spell-checking, integrated documentation tooling, or the pre-configured playground & examples... _Stacks has it all._

**üí° Delightful VS Code integration**

IDE Capabilities, such as type hints, code completion, code formatting, and more, are all natively built-in within Stacks. _Without the need of Prettier._

**üßôüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Extremely beginner & expert-friendly**

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs & functions without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript‚Äîthat's all you need to dive in now!

## Get Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework. You may "Use this template" (via the button in top right corner of this page), or run the following snippet of code in your terminal:

```bash
# ensure Node 16 or higher is installed
npx artisan make:stack hello-world
```

## ü§ñ Usage

The following is a list of some of the most common ways to use interact with the Stacks API:

```bash
# this functionality is WIP
npx artisan install # installs deps (for all workspaces)
npx artisan fresh # fresh reinstall of all deps

npx artisan dev # runs a local dev server of your stack
npx artisan docs:dev # starts local dev server for docs
npx artisan example # select to run one of examples (follow CLI prompts)

npx artisan commit # follow CLI prompts for committing changes
npx artisan release # releases the library (packages) to npm

# Building for Production
npx artisan build # select a specific build (follow CLI prompts)
npx artisan build:all # builds component & function libraries
npx artisan functions:build # builds the function library
npx artisan components:build # builds the component libraries
npx artisan docs:build # command to use when deploying to Vercel or Netlify
```

_The `package.json` contains additional useful snippets you may want to be aware of._

Because we optimize toward the development of easily reusable & composable component & function libraries, our primary intention is to always _keep it simple, yet configurable._ Hence, by default, Stacks bundles several libraries for you:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <!-- A "Custom Element"/Web Component Library is automatically created for you -->
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="hello-world-elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

If you prefer using the Vue syntax, a Vue 2 & 3 compatible library also gets automatically generated for you:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-vue'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

You may view this framework as a "great set of frames" to assist in efficiently bootstrapping, designing, and managing component libraries‚Äîusing industry best-practices, to reach one of the broadest user bases.
