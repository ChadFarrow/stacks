# The Modern Monorepo

The Stacks framework helps kick-start development of your next monorepo/component library, pre-configured with all the bells & whistles you need to get started & be productive. The ultimate goal of this framework is to assist in creating an interoperable library to reach the broadest developer audience.

_"The smart way to build component libraries."_ - Chris Breuer

## üí° Get Started

It's easy to get your component library started with this starter kit. The only prerequisite is a basic understanding of how to work with Vue Single File Components (SFCs). In other words, there is virtually no learning curve because "HTML with sprinkled JavaScript" will get you _incredibly_ far.

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
npx degit openwebstacks/stacks-starter hello-world-stack
cd hello-world-stack

pnpm i -r # install dependencies for all packages
pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use

pnpm build # builds a specific library
pnpm build:all # builds the library for production-ready use
pnpm example # run one of the examples
pnpm commit # opens CLI prompt for committing changes
pnpm release # releases the library (packages) to npm
```

Additionally, the `package.json` contains some useful snippets you likely want to be aware of.

## ü§ñ Usage

Because this monorepo is optimized toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, it's very easy to use (and distribute):

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Optional: if you prefer using Vue:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-stack'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```
