# Stacks - The Modern Monorepo

Stacks help kick-start development of your next monorepo/component library, pre-configured with all the tools you need to get started. Including the superpowers of interoperability.

## üí° Get Started

It's easy to get your component library started with this starter kit. The only prerequisite is a basic understanding of how to design/develop Vue Single File Components (SFCs). In other words, there is virtually no learning curve because HTML with sprinkled JavaScript will get you incredibly far.

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
npx degit openwebstacks/stacks-starter hello-world-stack
cd hello-world-stack

pnpm i -r # install deps for all packages
pnpm dev # stubs the libraries for local use

# starts the dev server for any of the examples
pnpm dev:vite-vue
pnpm dev:vite-wc

pnpm build # builds the library for production-ready use
```

Additionally, the `package.json` contains some useful snippets you likely want to be aware of.

## ü§ñ Usage

Because this monorepo is optimized toward the development of easily reusable & composable component libraries, it's very easy to use (and distribute):

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <hello-world name="Jane Doe"></hello-world>
    <script src="elements.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

_Optional: if you prefer using Vue_

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import HelloWorld from 'hello-world-stack'
</script>

<template>
  <HelloWorld name="J Doe" />
</template>
```

### Tips

This project also includes a simple way to handle your versioning. Through semantic commit names, it will also generate the 2 changelogs: one as part of the GitHub releases & the one markdown file that's created within the root of the project.

```bash
# how to create a git commit?
git add . # select the changes you want to commit
pnpm run commit # then simply follow the prompts

# after you successfully committed, you may create a "release"
pnpm run release # automates git commits, versioning, and CHANGELOG generation
```
