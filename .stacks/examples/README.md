# Stacks Examples

This folder contains all the examples utilizing the Stacks framework. Its primary use-case is to act as a starting part for you to showcase examples of your Stack.

For instance, "examples" of your component library are incredibly important in order to find adoption. In this case, your goal is to create a codebase that is as easy to use as possible, while also ensuring the integration is seamless.

Currently, the following examples are covered:

- [x] Vue
- [x] Web Components
- [ ] Nuxt
- [ ] Svelte
- [ ] React
- [ ] Next
- [ ] Remix
- [ ] Solid

If any of these uncompleted examples look like a fun project to you, any help is appreciated. 😊

## How is the Playground different from an example?

The playground is almost the "same" as an example. The difference lies in the dependencies that are required: the playground requires a locally symlinked version (enabled via `pnpm run dev`'s passive watching) and an examples requires the dependencies direct from npm.

For those reasons, the playground is perfectly suited for your local development.
