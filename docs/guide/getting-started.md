# Getting Started

It's incredibly easy to get started with this framework. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
# not working atm
sh <(curl stacksjs.org) my-project

# alternatively, if Bun >= v1.0 is installed already,
# you may also get started via:
bunx stacks new my-project
```
