# What is Stacks?

Stacks is a rapid application & library development framework for TypeScript. The goal of the framework is to help you create & maintain frontends, backends, and clouds—without having to worry about the boilerplate.

- Web & Desktop applications
- Serverless & traditional APIs
- Cloud infrastructure creation & maintenance
- Interactive CLIs
- Framework-agnostic component & function libraries
- Deployment & Release Manager _(CI & CD)_

Stacks helps you every step along the way—in beginner & expert-friendly ways, allowing you to focus on the _what_ and _why_ of your project.

> “Convention over configuration” is the Stacks mantra. _- Chris_
