# Bootcamp

This bootcamp is a collection of tutorials, guides, and resources to help you get started with Stacks. Read along to learn about the features that make up the core Stacks logic.

## Features

The Stacks framework is a harmony of several “engines”, designed to build any web and/or desktop application—in highly scalable & privacy-friendly ways. It consists of the following engines:

### Stacks UI

_Develop dynamic UIs with helpers for atomic design, and much more._

- 🧩 **Components** _a primitive to develop user interfaces_
- 🤖 **Functions** _a primitive to develop business logic (and grant your UI superpowers)_
- 🌐 **Web** _"a routing & templating engine that makes sense" using components—SSG & PWA ready_
- 🖥️ **Desktop** _automagically build a desktop app out of your web app_
- 📚 **Library** _auto-builds component & function libraries_
- ⚡️ Powered by Bun, Nitro, Tauri, UnoCSS, Vite & Vue

### Stacks Functions

_Develop serverless (or server) functions with countless helpers to build scalable & fast APIs._

- 🪄 **AI** _deep AI integration_
- 🤖 **APIs** _scalability & maintainability built-in_
- 🏎️ **Cache** _Redis, DynamoDB, Upstash, SingleStore, and more—serverless_
- ⚙️ **CLIs** _create beautiful CLIs for Linux, Windows, and Mac—without requirements_
- 📀 **Database** _MySQL, Postgres, PlanetScale, Supabase, Prisma, ..._
- 👾 **Errors** _native type-safe error handling_
- 🗓️ **Events** _functional event (front & backend) communication_
- 📢 **Notifications** _emails, SMSs, direct, and push notifications & webhooks_
- 🗺️ **ORM** _supercharged, fully-typed models & relations (including automated migrations)_
- 💳 **Payments** _unified API for one-off & subscription billing methods for Stripe_
- ⚙️ **Queues** _run any heavy workload in the background_
- 🛠️ **Query Builder** _powerful, type-safe SQL query builder_
- 💬 **Realtime** _“everything you need to build dynamic real-time apps”_
- 🧭 **Router** _smart routing, file-based or Laravel-like_
- 🔎 **Search Engine** _smart searching, advanced filtering & sorting, pagination, headless UI_
- 💾 **Storage** _easily create & make use of local & remote storages/file systems_
- 🧪 **Tinker** _a powerful TypeScript REPL_
- 🌪️ **Validation** _e2e type-safety (true frontend & backend harmony)_
- 🎯 **X-Ray** _all you need to debug, log & analyze_

### Stacks Cloud

_Create your personal or professional Vercel-like cloud, based on MIT-licensed OSS._

- ☁️ **Server** _local development server & production-ready servers_
- ⛅️ **Serverless** _on-demand, auto-scaling, zero maintenance_
- 🚏 **CDN** _zero-config low-latency CDN, including request life-cycle hooks & optimized request compressions (Brotli & gzip)_
- 🔀 **Domain** _version-controlled & zero-config domain management (e.g. DNS management)_
- 📧 **Email** _secure & simplistic <easy-peasy@custom-domains.com> mail_
- 🔐 **Firewall** _native web application firewall support_
- 🚜 **Maintenance** _maintain your cloud infrastructure with ease using Buddy & Stacks_
- 🤖 **Infrastructure as Code** _version-controlled cloud infrastructure_

### Stacks CI/CD

_Focus on coding, not publishing._

- 🚀 **Deployment Manager** _take the sweat out of production deployments (AWS, Vercel, Netlify, and more)_
- 📫 **Release Manager** _libraries (component & function) auto-published to npm, git helpers, and more_

### Stacks DX

_Enhanced productivity for developers. No more creating boilerplate._

- 💡 **IDE Integration** _auto-completions, inline docs & a powerful VS Code setup_
- 🪄 **Zero-Config** _yet highly configurable—convention over configuration_
- 👩🏽‍🔧 **Linter & Formatter** _auto-configured & built into your IDE_
- 💪🏼 **Type Strong** _built-in e2e type-safety_
- ✨ **Git Workflows** _committing with ease_
- 🚗 **Auto Imports** _your components & functions, including date, string, array, & object helpers_
- ⏩ **Code Snippets** _say goodbye to the boilerplate—thank you Sarah Drasner_
- 🔤 **Spell Checker** _be notified once there are typos_
- 🛠️ **Utilities** _Collections, VueUse, and more_
- 🧪 **Testing** _unit & e2e tests powered by Bun & Playwright_

No matter whether you are a beginner or an expert, the approachable Stacks design allows you to learn at your own pace, using our thorough documentation covering every aspect of the framework. Stacks is extremely beginner & expert-friendly.

Develop beautiful, reactive, composable UIs without learning a new set of languages. HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript—that's all you need to dive in now! _Or TypeScript ✌🏼_
