# @ow3/playground

This folder contains the files for your development playground.

## How is the Playground different from an example?

A playground is almost "identical" to examples. The core difference lies in the dependencies that are required: the playground requires a locally, symlinked version (enabled via `pnpm run dev`'s passive watching) and examples require the dependencies strictly from released npm versions.

For those reasons, the playground is perfectly suited for your local development.
