# 🤖 Your Apps

This folder contains your framework bootstrapped applications. Based on the answers provided during the installation process, you will find the following apps:

- a web app _(SSG & PWA ready)_
- a Desktop application _(Mac, Linux, Windows)_
- a CLI _(built your own commands)_
- a markdown-powered site, like a documentation _(powered by VitePress)_

Feel free to adjust the bootstrapped apps to your needs. _You may also find lots of useful information in our docs._

> **Note**
> You can create as many as apps you want and name them however. The only requirement is that they are located in this folder for CI/CD reasons.
