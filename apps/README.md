# 🤖 Your Apps

This folder contains your framework bootstrapped applications. Based on the answers provided during the installation process, you will find the following apps:

- 🌐 A Web app _(SSG & PWA ready)_
- 🖥️ A Desktop app _(Mac, Linux, Windows)_
- 🤖 A CLI _(built your own commands)_
- 📚 A Markdown-powered site _(like a documentation site)_

Feel free to adjust the bootstrapped apps to your needs. _You may also find lots of useful information in our docs._

> **Note**
> You can create as many as apps you want and name them however. For CI/CD reasons, though, the only requirement is that additional apps are located in this folder.
