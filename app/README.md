# The App Folder

The `app` folder is divided into the following subfolders:

- `cli` - Place your custom commands here.
- `docs` - Place your markdown documentation here.
- `models` - Place your models here.
- `notifications` - Place your notifications here.
- `pages` - Place your pages here. _Think of it as `views` in a traditional MVC application._
